Understanding the Java Class Structure

1) In Java programs, classes are the basic building blocks. When defning a class, you describe
all the parts and characteristics of one of those building blocks. To use most classes, you
have to create objects. An object is a runtime instance of a class in memory. All the various
objects of all the different classes represent the state of your program.
 
 class---->objects---->methods------>variables
 
2) Fields and Methods:
  Java classes have two primary elements: methods, often called functions or procedures in
other languages, and fields, more generally known as variables. Together these are called the
members of the class.Variables hold the state of the program, and methods operate on that
state.Itâ€™s the programmer who creates and arranges these elements in such a way that
the resulting code is useful and, ideally, easy for other programmers to understand. a word with special meaning is a keyword.
